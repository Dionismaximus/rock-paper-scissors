## About Website
The website is an interactive rock-paper-scissors game. The project was selected by one of the proposed options to choose from.
The website gives an opportunity to play a mini-game with the computer of 10 rounds. The user can choose one of the options, after which the computer makes its own random choice.
In each round a winner is determined based on the following logic: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, with the same choice - the round ends in a draw.
After 10 rounds, the winner by the most wins is determined.
